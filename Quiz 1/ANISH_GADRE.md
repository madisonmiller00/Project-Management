# Anish's Quiz 1
## Why I like EVs
I am a car enthusiast, and I have recently become a big fan of electric vehicles. I have been driving a Tesla Model 3 for the past three years, and the transition from a gas-powered Audi was difficult at first. My Tesla uses one-pedal driving, so I rarely use the brakes because of regenerative braking. It also relies on a large central screen instead of multiple smaller displays, and I charge the car rather than stopping at a gas station. At this point, it actually feels strange for me to put gas in a car.
