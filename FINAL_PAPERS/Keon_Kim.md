## Designing and Managing an Open Source Habit Tracking Web Application
Keon Kim, Fall 2025

## Abstract 

In this paper, I present a hypothetical open-source habit tracking web application that I designed and managed using open principles. The project is structured around a modern full-stack architecture that includes Next.js for the front end, Node and Express for the back end, PostgreSQL for relational data storage, Prisma ORM for database interaction, Auth0 for authentication, and Vercel for deployment. While these technologies provide an efficient and accessible development environment, they also introduce tradeoffs related to technical debt, scalability, and contributor onboarding. Drawing on Professor Alicea’s frameworks for open source project development, I describe the motivation behind the application, the community it is intended to support, the workflow that structures its evolution, and the governance practices that help sustain it over time. I use materials from reflection assignments and planning artifacts from GitHub project boards to illustrate real project management practices such as issue tracking, milestone definition, schema planning, authentication flow design, and iterative rescoping. Together, these components demonstrate how a personal idea can evolve into a structured open source project supported by transparent documentation, collaborative decision making, and community participation.

***Introduction***

Digital productivity tools have become an essential part of how people organize their daily lives, manage responsibilities, and work toward long-term goals. Habit tracking applications in particular are widely used to support consistency, accountability, and self-improvement. Many of these tools encourage users to record routines, visualize progress, and reflect on behavioral patterns over time. Research on habit formation shows that behaviors become automatic through repeated actions in stable contexts over extended periods rather than through short bursts of motivation, which reinforces the value of long-term habit tracking tools (Singh et al., 2024). Despite their popularity, most habit tracking platforms are commercial products that operate as closed systems. These platforms often limit user control over data, obscure how information is stored or analyzed, and restrict customization to features determined by the company rather than the user community. These limitations motivated me to imagine and design an open-source habit tracking web application. I was interested in exploring how a habit tracking tool could be built around transparency, user agency, and collaboration rather than proprietary control. Digital behavior change research emphasizes that transparency and user trust are key factors in the effectiveness of habit formation technologies (Zhu et al., 2024). I was interested in exploring how a habit tracking tool could be built around transparency, user agency, and collaboration rather than proprietary control. I wanted to create a project that not only served end users but also functioned as a learning environment for programmers interested in understanding real-world full-stack development. By building the project openly, I aimed to create a space where contributors could examine design decisions, suggest improvements, and participate in shaping the application’s evolution. The purpose of this project is to design a tool that helps users understand and improve their behavior patterns through reflective data visualization. Habit tracking encourages individuals to slow down and observe how small actions accumulate over time. A well-designed digital platform can support this process by presenting information in a clear and meaningful way, helping users recognize patterns and adjust routines intentionally (Singh et al., 2024). My motivation for building this tool openly also comes from a desire to give users ownership over their data and to model ethical development practices that prioritize transparency and accountability. The decision to use a modern web development stack reflects both educational and practical goals. Next.js and React provide a strong foundation for building interactive user interfaces that respond dynamically to user input. Node and Express support the back-end logic and API structure needed to manage user data and application behavior. PostgreSQL offers reliable relational data storage, while Prisma simplifies database access and schema management. Auth0 provides secure authentication without requiring the implementation of a custom identity system, and Vercel enables streamlined deployment and continuous integration. Together, these tools form a system that is approachable for new contributors while still capable of supporting production-level functionality.

***Project Vision and Community***

The core vision of this project is to create a transparent and customizable habit tracking application that supports personal growth through reflection and data awareness. Unlike many commercial alternatives, this project emphasizes openness at every stage of development. From the initial planning documents to the final implementation, decisions are documented and shared publicly so that contributors and users can understand how and why the system works as it does. The project community includes several overlapping groups. First, it serves individuals who prefer open source productivity tools and value transparency in how their personal data is collected, stored, and used. Research on digital habit formation emphasizes that users are more likely to trust and continue using systems that make data practices visible and understandable (Zhu et al., 2024). Second, the project supports learners who want hands-on experience with full-stack web development in a realistic project environment. Third, the project invites experienced developers who are interested in contributing to a growing ecosystem of personal data applications. This approach aligns with Professor Alicea’s emphasis on identifying community needs and motivations as a foundational step in open source project design. Habit tracking appeals to students, professionals, and individuals pursuing self-improvement, but the reasons for using such tools vary widely. Evidence from habit formation studies shows that consistency and flexibility are more effective than rigid enforcement when supporting long-term behavior change (Singh et al., 2024). By building the application openly, contributors can help shape features such as calendar integration, routine templates, progress charts, streak tracking, and community check-in tools. Transparency in design also ensures that users understand how their data is processed and visualized, which helps build trust between the application and its community. Reflections I completed earlier in the semester reinforced the importance of this project as both a technical challenge and an opportunity to build something meaningful for real users. Open source collaboration also reflects course themes of shared responsibility, community building, and iterative improvement. Rather than viewing development as a linear process with a fixed endpoint, this project treats development as an ongoing conversation between contributors, users, and maintainers.

***Technology Stack and Rationale***

The technology choices for this project were guided by my familiarity with modern web development tools as well as broader trends in the open source ecosystem. Next.js was selected for the front end because it provides server-side rendering, routing, and a file-based structure that simplifies application organization. These features support scalability and improve performance while making the codebase easier for new contributors to understand. The use of React allows contributors to work with a component-based architecture that is widely used and well-documented. Node and Express form the back-end foundation of the application. This combination offers flexibility in API design and integrates smoothly with the front end. Express allows for clear routing and middleware configuration, which is important for handling user requests, authentication, and data validation. PostgreSQL was chosen as the database because of its strong support for relational data and transactional integrity. Habit tracking involves relationships between users, habits, timestamps, and historical records, which are well-suited to a relational model. Prisma simplifies database interaction by providing a type-safe interface and explicit schema definition. This makes it easier for contributors to understand the data model and reduces the likelihood of errors during development. Prisma also supports migration planning, which is important as the application evolves. Auth0 was selected to manage authentication and authorization, reducing the need to implement complex security features manually. While this introduces a dependency on an external service, it also ensures secure user management and allows development efforts to focus on core functionality (Zhu et al., 2024). Vercel supports deployment and continuous integration, making it easier to test changes and maintain a stable public version of the application. Automatic builds and previews help contributors see the impact of their changes before merging them into the main branch. These technology choices are reflected in the planning artifacts documented through GitHub issues. Tasks such as planning initial API endpoints, implementing authentication flows, and resolving blocked schema dependencies represent real design challenges that contributors would encounter. The workflow map I developed supports this stack by outlining clear phases for planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

***Working Open Principles***

Open source projects depend on transparency, communication, and shared ownership. I designed this project around several working open principles that guide both technical and social aspects of development. First, all major decisions related to API structure, database schema, authentication, and tooling are documented directly in the repository. This documentation allows contributors to understand not only what decisions were made but also the reasoning behind those decisions. By making this information public, the project reduces ambiguity and supports informed participation. Second, I used issue-driven planning as the primary method for organizing development work. GitHub Issues serve as the central space for tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests. The project board includes categories such as To Do, In Progress, Blocked, and Retrospective, which reflect agile planning practices. This structure makes progress visible and helps contributors understand the current state of the project at a glance. Third, I emphasized transparent rescoping. Several issues include notes about changes in direction, such as adjusting schema designs or expanding authentication features. Documenting these changes openly helps reduce hidden technical debt and demonstrates thoughtful project oversight. Rather than treating changes as failures, the project treats them as opportunities to adapt based on new information. Fourth, the project encourages community feedback through discussion spaces such as GitHub Discussions or external communication channels. These spaces allow users to suggest features, report issues, and help prioritize future development. Finally, I included shared governance structures such as a code of conduct and contributor guidelines. These documents establish expectations for respectful communication and provide clear instructions for proposing changes or submitting pull requests.

***Workflow and Roadmap***

The workflow for this project follows five stages. The first stage focuses on planning and setup, which includes defining roles, outlining user needs, setting up the repository, and creating early design documents. The second stage involves development, where the front end, back end, database schema, and authentication flow are implemented. Regular reviews and pull request feedback help maintain code quality and shared understanding. The third stage centers on testing and refinement, including quality assurance testing, bug fixes, and interface improvements based on user feedback. The fourth stage covers deployment and launch, where the application is deployed to Vercel, performance is monitored, and early configuration issues are resolved. The final stage focuses on maintenance and growth through retrospectives, periodic upgrades, and ongoing feature tracking. This roadmap reflects the structured development lifecycle discussed in class and demonstrates how clearly defined phases support momentum and clarity in open source projects. By revisiting these stages regularly, the project remains adaptable while maintaining direction.

***Technical Debt Awareness***

Through earlier reflections, I recognized that any technical stack introduces both short-term and long-term technical debt. In this project, potential concerns include version changes in frameworks like Next.js, abstraction limitations in Prisma, dependency on Auth0 and Vercel, scaling challenges, and configuration drift related to environment variables. These concerns are visible in the project’s issue history, including blocked tasks and configuration errors. By documenting these risks and planning for scheduled refactoring and backlog management, the project addresses technical debt proactively rather than ignoring it. This approach helps ensure that the application remains maintainable and accessible to contributors over time.

***Governance Structures***

To support long-term sustainability, the project incorporates governance structures such as a controlled vocabulary for database objects and API endpoints, documentation standards for onboarding, contributor guidelines for pull request workflows, and a code of conduct to promote respectful collaboration. Regular feedback cycles and retrospectives help ensure that governance evolves alongside the project. These structures align with models presented in the lecture, where distributed decision-making and public documentation enable scalable collaboration.

***Future Pathways and Extensions***

Future versions of the application could include enhanced analytics for habit patterns, social features such as shared habit groups, calendar integration, mobile extensions, gamification elements, and optional self-hosted deployments for privacy-sensitive users. These ideas reflect a long-term vision similar to the multiyear milestone planning approaches discussed in class.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a personal idea can develop into a structured open source initiative through thoughtful planning, transparent documentation, and community-centered governance. By applying open working principles, using an issue-driven workflow, and acknowledging technical debt, I designed a project positioned for sustainable growth. The habit tracking application represents not only a technical artifact, but also a learning environment, a community resource, and a platform for collaboration.
