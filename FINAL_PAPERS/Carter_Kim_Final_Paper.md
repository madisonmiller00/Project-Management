# TITLE : Mobile order app for local coffee shops
Carter Kim, Fall 25


## Introduction
In the fast-paced society we live in, people do not want to waste time on anything. The desire to seek optimization in every aspect of life is prevalent. Take grocery shopping, for example. Twenty years ago, nobody thought of having their groceries delivered to their doorstep with just a couple of scrolls and clicks. The integration of technology into the services we use daily has significantly made our lives better. However, I have noticed that the coffee industry, unlike other daily services, has not built an efficient way of delivering its service to people. Part of the reason could be its culture; people often don't want to rush the experience, preferring to savor every bit of it. However, this doesn’t account for coffee drinkers in a mega-city. People rush in and out, looking for a drink to wake their sleep-deprived bodies up and kick off the day. Big coffee franchises like Starbucks or Dunkin’ offer "Siren Order" (mobile ordering) where you can pick up your drink at your desired time to avoid waiting. But those big franchises offer limited options. You usually can’t select specific beans or drip styles. Local coffee shops offer these options, but they lack the technology to provide mobile ordering. As a result, if you want to drink good coffee but have no time to wait, you are forced to settle for a big franchise’s unified, over-roasted coffee due to this technological gap. 

The purpose of my local coffee shop mobile ordering app is to solve this problem. It builds a bridge between busy coffee lovers and local coffee shops that lack this technology.

## Motivation
I chose this topic because I am a huge coffee enthusiast. As described earlier, big franchises like Starbucks offer great convenience to their customers through the Siren order (mobile ordering) functionality on their apps. People can order and even customize their drinks and simply show up to pick them up. This ensures people don't waste time waiting in line or waiting for backed-up orders at the counter. However, big franchises have prioritized consistency over quality. A prime example of this business strategy is over-roasting their beans. Major coffee chains over-roast their beans to unify the flavor profile, ensuring the same experience for clients all over the world. While the pro of over-roasting is consistency, the con is a foul, bitter taste. Moreover, they rely on automated machines to brew coffee; while powerful enough to produce many cups in a short span, these machines can ruin the nuanced taste of the coffee. On the other hand, local coffee shops prioritize taste over uniformity. Because they don't have thousands of stores to manage, they can focus on quality. Local shops enhance the flavor through methods like letting customers choose their specific beans, using adequate roast levels, or offering hand-drip styles. Yet, despite serving the best-tasting coffee, local shops lack the technology to offer the Siren order convenience that big franchises do. Furthermore, since most are small, independent businesses, there is no central system or app to tie them together. When I have free time, I don’t mind waiting for my coffee; I enjoy the vibe and the smell of roasting beans. But during my internship in Seoul, waiting for my morning coffee was impossible. Running into large groups of office workers when I only had a few minutes to spare before running late to the office was the worst experience. I sometimes had to wait as long as 20 minutes. As a result, I stopped going to local shops and began sacrificing taste for the time-saving convenience of big franchises. Launching a Siren order app for local coffee shops will allow coffee lovers like me to enjoy high-quality coffee without worrying about being late to work or feeling rushed. Another primary motivation for this project is to support the small businesses around me. I am passionate about supporting the local economy. Through this mobile ordering functionality, local coffee shops can regain the customers they lost due to the technology gap. These are my primary motivations for undertaking this work.

Figure.1 shows the transaction volume of Starbucks. They get 31% of their entire transactions through mobile order and the sheer volume has been growing over the years. 31% is huge and shouldn’t be neglected. The local coffee shops are currently missing this opportunity. 

## Project Statement
This project is about developing a centralized mobile ordering application designed specifically for local/independent coffee shops, bridging the technological gap between local cafes and global franchises. Currently, urban professionals are often forced to compromise between the superior taste of local coffee and the convenience of big chain order ahead systems, resulting in significant revenue loss for small businesses that cannot offer siren order technology. By implementing a platform that enables users to customize, order, and pay for premium coffee in advance, this project aims to empower local cafes to recapture the lost market transaction volume and to allow busy customers to enjoy high quality coffee without the wait while supporting the local small business economy.

## Target Audience
### Primary users
This application's target population consists primarily of busy urban professionals, students, and owners of local cafes who prioritize both quality and efficiency. In the fast-paced modern society, these individuals often face a dilemma I described in the personal motivation section: they desire the superior taste and unique vibe of local coffee shops but are forced to choose big franchises due to time constraints before work or classes. This platform will assist them in optimizing their morning routines by eliminating wait times, allowing them to integrate high quality coffee consumption into their tight schedules. Additionally, the audience includes digital natives who are accustomed to the convenience of mobile interfaces and cashless transactions. Unlike the typical customer of a large franchise who accepts standardized, over-roasted beans, these users are interested in the specific nuances of their drink such as bean origin, roast level, or drip style and require a technological solution that bridges the gap between their sophisticated taste preferences and their need for speed. Moreover, the demand for good tasting or high quality coffee is increasing.

### Benefits
Time optimization is the core benefit; by utilizing real-time queue monitoring and order ahead functionality, the platform ensures that the coffee is ready exactly when the user arrives, removing the frustration of unpredictable wait times. Furthermore, the platform acts as a centralized discovery tool, integrating various independent cafes into a single interface. This allows users to explore and support multiple small businesses in their area without needing to download separate apps for each shop. 

## Development Methodology
### Open Source Development	
This project will be developed as an open-source initiative, ensuring that its design, source code, and API integrations are publicly accessible and open to continuous enhancement by a community of developers, coffee enthusiasts, and local business advocates. By embracing open-source principles, the project will encourage collaboration, innovation, and transparency, allowing anyone with an interest in leveling the playing field between small cafes and corporate giants to contribute and refine its functionalities. The development process will actively involve users from various backgrounds, particularly university students, independent shop owners, and freelance developers. This inclusive approach will help address the unique technological gaps that small businesses face when trying to implement complex mobile ordering systems, ensuring that the app effectively meets the nuanced needs of both the cafe owners and the customer. Through community-driven development, the app can adapt to the real-world workflow of a busy local cafe.

### Agile Development	
An Agile development methodology is a powerful methodology to address the need to balance the distinct and urgent requirements of rush-hour commuters and fast-paced kitchen environments. This iterative approach allows the team to rapidly adapt to real world feedback without disrupting the entire production line whether it involves refining the barista dashboard for better visibility or adding new customization options for coffee drinkers. Instead of rigid planning, Agile ensures the application remains flexible, enabling the seamless integration of emerging market trends, such as new payment gateways or brewing methods, as the needs of the coffee community evolve. 
To support this dynamic process, the development will be anchored by structured workflow mapping and CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment) strategies. Workflow mapping provides a clear architectural blueprint, ensuring that open-source contributors can easily understand complex interactions, particularly the real-time synchronization between a user’s smartphone and the shop’s order management system. Simultaneously, CI/CD pipelines automate the testing and deployment phases. This automation is critical for minimizing system downtime during peak business hours, ensuring that updates are delivered reliably and that the app maintains the high stability required by local business owners.

## Workflow Mapping
![workflow](workflow.jpg)

To begin, the workflow identifies initial stages such as researching the specific pain points of local cafe owners and the purchasing habits of rush-hour commuters through market research. From there, the process transitions to designing the app, where the user interface for deep customization (e.g., bean selection, milk options) and the corresponding shop-side order management system are drafted. A crucial step follows, involving design approval from stakeholder representatives, including potential pilot cafe owners. Once approved, the project advances to development, separated into two sprints: the first focusing on the core siren order logic(backend) and payment gateway integration, and the shop dashboard usability. Each sprint ensures step-by-step progress while allowing room for adjustments based on the technical constraints of small business hardware. App development work ultimately leads to a functioning prototype, which goes through rigorous performance testing : specifically testing order synchronization latency to ensure orders appear instantly on the cafe's end. A key decision point involves prototype approval. If issues arise, such as notification delays or menu syncing errors, the team must loop back to refine the backend architecture before proceeding. After successful testing, the app is submitted to app stores, followed by the onboarding of the first wave of local cafes and a marketing launch. Post launch, the workflow emphasizes monitoring app uptime and collecting feedback from both coffee drinkers and baristas. If actionable feedback is identified, such as the need for more granular roast descriptions, updates are pushed to improve the app iteratively. This process ensures that the app remains a reliable bridge between customers and shops. By clearly mapping out each phase of the project, this workflow provides a structured and flexible foundation for managing development tasks, coordinating between technical teams and local business partners, and maintaining accountability. It also highlights key decisive points, such as the successful synchronization of orders, which ensure the app meets its intended goal of speed and quality at every stage. This level of organization enables the team to focus on delivering a high quality, accessible app while adapting to the dynamic environment of the food and beverage industry.

## Technology
### Technology that will be used 
The technological foundations of this mobile ordering platform are selected to handle the intense traffic surges during morning rush hours without compromising speed. Front-end development uses React Native, a framework based on the JavaScript library React, which allows for the creation of dynamic, cross-platform mobile applications for both iOS and Android. This ensures that the complex siren order interface where users customize beans, temperature, and milk remains responsive and intuitive on any device. The platform's back end uses Node.js, which is fast, scalable, and highly efficient in handling server requests. Node.js is particularly critical for this project due to its non-blocking I/O model, allowing the application to process multiple incoming orders simultaneously in real-time. This ensures that when a customer hits an order, the shop receives it instantly without latency. It utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database well suited for the flexibility required in a cafe menu. Unlike rigid SQL databases, MongoDB does not limit how data is structured. Therefore, it is suitable for storing varied and complex customization options (such as different roast levels or seasonal syrups) across different independent shops. Altogether, these technologies provide a robust and scalable foundation capable of bridging the gap between local businesses and modern consumers. 

## Managing Technical Debt
We anticipate moderate technical debt accrual. Specifically, there should be about 15-25% additional development time anticipated due to the integration complexities with various third-party Point of Sale (POS) APIs (such as Square, Toast, or Clover) used by different local shops. Additionally, we estimate 5-10% additional maintenance time due to potential versioning issues with real-time WebSocket dependencies required for instant order synchronization.
To minimize technical debt, I would focus on proactive measures and modular design. Latency testing and load testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines will be implemented to detect synchronization issues and regressions before they affect the rush-hour user experience. Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions ensure that emerging technical debt, particularly in the menu customization logic, is addressed efficiently. Additionally, maintaining detailed documentation of API endpoints and encouraging knowledge sharing among team members facilitates smooth maintenance. By utilizing cloud-based services (AWS), open-source libraries, and a modular architecture that separates the user interface from the shop dashboard, the initial technical debt is minimized, ensuring a seamless and intuitive coffee ordering experience.
Thinking into the next 5 years, the technology behind the platform may require costly updates to maintain efficiency, security, and scalability as the network of partner cafes grows. Initial costs could range from $10,000 to $20,000 for updating React Native and Node.js frameworks, which are essential for the app's cross-platform functionality. Additionally, the database (MongoDB) will need to be expanded to accommodate increased transaction logs and user history, with estimated costs between $5,000 and $10,000. Cloud hosting costs will also rise as the user base grows, potentially adding $5,000 to $10,000 annually for increased server capacity to handle peak morning traffic.
As new versions of iPhone and Android operating systems are released, the app will need to be adapted for compatibility, potentially requiring significant rewrites costing between $20,000 and $40,000. Enhancing security measures to protect user payment data and ensure PCI compliance will also be critical, with associated costs ranging from $10,000 to $20,000. These updates will ensure the app operates smoothly and maintains the trust of both customers and business owners. 

## Community Building & Ecosystem Strategy 
Unlike a standalone utility app, the local cafe siren order platform relies on a two-sided marketplace. Success depends on building a cohesive ecosystem that unites three distinct groups: Independent business owners (partners), coffee enthusiasts (users), and open source contributors (developers). Our community building strategy focuses on harmonizing these groups to create a sustainable local coffee culture. 

1.The partner network (local cafe owners) The foundation of our community is the network of local coffee shops. Unlike big franchises, these owners often lack technical expertise but possess deep knowledge of coffee.

    1a) Engagement strategy: we will establish a Partner council, a small group of early adopter cafe owners who provide direct feedback on the dashboard's usability and operational workflow.
     
    1b) Support & education: Instead of standard technical documentation, we will provide operational playbooks and video guides on how to integrate mobile orders into a busy barista workflow without disrupting service quality. 
    
    1c))Value proposition: by framing the app as a "Small Business Alliance," we foster a sense of solidarity among owners, encouraging them to promote the app to their loyal customers as a way to support local commerce. 

2.The user community (coffee enthusiasts) For the consumers, the community strategy shifts from "utility" to "discovery and taste." The goal is to turn passive customers into active advocates for local coffee.
   
  2a)Social discovery: the app will feature a "bean review" and "cafe discovery" forum where users can share tasting notes and recommend hidden gems. This taps into the "coffee connoisseur" aspect of the target audience.
   
  2b)Campus ambassadors: we will recruit student ambassadors(from u of i) to promote the app during exam week which is a prime time for caffeine consumption, creating a grassroots movement against franchise dominance. 
  
  2c)Gamification: we will implement a community wide local loyalty leaderboard, rewarding users who visit the most unique local shops, encouraging exploration over routine. 

3.The developer guild (open source contributors) This group focuses on the technical scalability of the platform. 

  3a) Focus Areas: we will direct open-source contributions toward specific technical challenges, such as POS API Integrations (connecting to Square, Toast, Clover) and Latency Optimization.
   
  3b) Hackathons: We will host tech for local hackathons, inviting computer science students to build plugins or features that specifically help small businesses, adding a social good motivation to their code contributions. 

## Conclusion
The local coffee shop Siren order project aims to revolutionize the coffee culture for students, professionals, and independent business owners by addressing the critical conflict between convenience and quality. Currently, coffee lovers are often forced to choose between the efficiency of major franchises and the superior taste of local coffee shops. By prioritizing a user-centered design that supports deep customization and real-time ordering, the app provides a seamless, premium experience that empowers users to save time without compromising on taste.
Through community-focused innovation and sustainable workflow integration, this project bridges the technological gap between modern consumers and local coffee shops, empowering small businesses to reclaim market share. By promoting the local economy, reducing wait-time frustration, and supporting a diverse coffee culture, this project demonstrates the power of technology to create meaningful, lasting solutions that benefit both the consumer and the small business community.
