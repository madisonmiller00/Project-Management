## Introduction

As a student at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, I have repeatedly seen a need for making everyday necessary tasks, like grocery shopping, easier and less stressful. Something as simple as grocery shopping can become difficult when students are under extreme academic pressure, internships, financial stress, time crunches, all while maintaining their social lives on campus. Grocery shopping can often feel like an additional burden on top of already demanding and full schedules. From my personal experience I have found myself choosing stores based on convenience, like the Champaign Target, rather than affordability or skipping trips entirely due to lack of transportation or time. These constant experiences revealed how even small inefficiencies can build over time and negatively impact students’ quality of life.

## Project Objective

This paper proposes a hypothetical open-source project called the Illini Grocery App, designed to specifically address grocery-related challenges that UIUC students and faculty may face. The goal of this paper is to describe the app itself and to demonstrate how I would manage its development using open-source principles and formal project management strategies to successfully launch the app. Some concepts I will discuss that I would potentially apply are Agile methodology, project scoping, community-driven development, feedback collection, and risk mitigation. I hope to explain this project to be a realistic, student-centered application that could be planned, built, and sustained. Creating this project based on my own experiences while applying structured project management techniques, I hope to show the thoughtful planning I have brainstormed to transform a personal idea into a viable and helpful initiative for my fellow students.

The need for a campus-specific grocery tool became apparent to me through both personal observation and conversations with my friends. Many university students rely on buses or walking to access grocery stores, which makes route planning and store selection very important. Prices for basic necessities can vary across nearby stores, like Target, Walmart, Meijer, however students often lack the time or tools to compare options efficiently. Yes, these stores have their inventory and prices online, but all on different sites with its own unique layout and some neglect important details that college students would need to decide which one to go to. Faculty members also face time constraints, with balancing teaching, research, and other personal responsibilities. These challenges show that grocery shopping is not just an inconvenience, but a structural issue affecting time management, accessibility, and financial ability across campus.

## User Research

To further validate this problem to ensure it’s a common need, I would start off this project with some preliminary user research. I plan to distribute short online surveys to UIUC students asking questions like how often they grocery shop, which stores they visit most frequently, if they would utilize an app to assist them, and what aspects of grocery shopping they find most frustrating or time consuming. I would also create other surveys to ask respondents to rank potential features such as price comparison, bus-route integration, store hours, and coupon tracking.

To maximize participation, I would advertise the survey through social media platforms that are popular amongst UIUC students, including Instagram, Snapchat class stories, TikTok, GroupMe, Reddit, and campus Facebook groups. Posting in class-specific GroupMe chats, student organization pages, and UIUC-focused subreddits would help reach a diverse range of students across majors, class years, and living situations. I also think that partnering with research organizations on campus would be a good idea to get ensured responses and offer some sort of compensation to participants, funded by the school. All these approaches will help ensure that the feedback for my project is not limited to my immediate social circle and helps confirm that the problem is widespread, and not just a personal issue.

## Project Scope

Based on initial research findings, I would define the Illini Grocery App as a lightweight, mobile app centered on efficiency, accessibility, and transparency. My goal is not to replicate a large commercial grocery platform; the app would focus specifically on UIUC and helping students and faculty make informed grocery decisions quickly and with minimal effort. Clearly defining the project’s scope at the beginning I believe is very critical to preventing feature creep, managing limited resources, and avoiding burnout among contributors, especially in a student-led open-source environment where time and availability are limited.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

To make this plan more realistic, I think the concept of a minimum viable product (MVP) is vital to this project. The MVP is a foundation that gives immediate value to users while also giving room for future iteration. For the Illini Grocery App, I would limit the first release or prototype to three core features: item price comparison, store hours and locations, and route mapping. I selected these features because they directly address the most common pain points that people and I have experienced, most frequently affordability, time constraints, and transportation access.

For example, a user searching for “eggs” would be able to view prices across multiple nearby grocery stores, along with distance, estimated travel time using public transportation, and whether the store is currently open. Each store’s page would show the hours of operation, address, bus routes, and walking distance from popular campus locations.

From a technical view, these features are also strategically chosen because they can be implemented incrementally without introducing too much complexity or confusion. Price comparison can initially rely on publicly available pricing data or manual updates, route mapping can use already existing APIs, and store information can be projected through a simple database structure. By prioritizing features in a beginning stage of this project that are both highly impactful and technically manageable, the MVP will stay realistic and within a student-managed timeline and will help new contributors adjust quickly to understand and participate in the codebase.

### Scope Exclusions

What is just as important is discussing what the MVP intentionally excludes. Advanced features such as personalized user accounts, price history tracking, or predictive coupon algorithms would be better for later phases of development. While these features might increase the long-term value, implementing them too early would potentially increase development time, introduce privacy concerns, and create unnecessary technical debt that could hurt future scalability.

## Iterative Development

I believe this approach will also help propel iterative development and community contribution. Once the MVP is released and validated through user feedback, additional features can be proposed and evaluated through open discussion forums and issue tracking systems. By clearly defining the MVP and its boundaries, the project maintains focus while still being adaptable.

## Feedback Integration

Once a beginning prototype of the Illini Grocery App is designed, I would like to hold usability testing sessions with a small but diverse group of students. During testing, participants would be asked to perform realistic tasks, such as searching for an item, comparing prices across stores, and planning a route to multiple locations. I would observe their interactions, collect qualitative feedback, and incorporate this feedback into iterative updates of the prototype. This approach aligns with Agile principles by creating short, iterative cycles of development, testing, and refinement.

## Feature Roadmap

Once the MVP is stable and has been validated through user feedback and prototype testing, future phases of development would be planned to introduce additional features. Phase two would focus on features that enhance usability and personalization without introducing excessive complexity, such as price history tracking and optional shopping lists. Phase three would focus on advanced community-driven features like crowd-sourced price updates and coupon aggregation. Each phase would follow Agile principles with defined sprints, user stories, and acceptance criteria.

## Open-Source Model and Licensing

Choosing an open-source model aligns with the community-focused nature of the app. Open-source development allows transparency in how data is collected, processed, and displayed. I would choose a license such as the General Public License (GPL), ensuring that all future modifications remain open-source and protecting contributor work.

## Team Structure

To manage contributions effectively, contributors would be divided into usability, design, and functionality teams. Each team would have clearly defined responsibilities and deliverables. Coordination would be supported through Kanban boards, decision logs, and weekly check-ins.

## Version Control, Automation, and Documentation

GitHub would serve as the central platform for version control, collaboration, and project management. All changes would be submitted through pull requests and reviewed before merging. Automation tools such as continuous integration pipelines would help maintain code quality, while comprehensive documentation would support onboarding and long-term maintainability.

## Risk Management

Potential risks include contributor drop-off, inaccurate data, and time constraints. These risks would be mitigated through clear onboarding processes, automation for data updates, community engagement, and transparent documentation and communication.

## Conclusion

I believe that the Illini Grocery App will be a powerful tool for simplifying grocery shopping and could be a successful student-centered initiative grounded in both user needs and project management concepts. Through surveys, interviews, and prototype testing, the project is designed to address real challenges faced by UIUC students and faculty. Applying structured project management practices and open-source principles demonstrates how thoughtful planning can transform a personal observation into a scalable solution for the campus community.
