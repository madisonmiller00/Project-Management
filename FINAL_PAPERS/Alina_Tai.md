## Introduction

As a student at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, I have repeatedly seen a need for making every day necessary tasks, like grocery shopping easier and less stressful. Something as simple as grocery shopping can become difficult when students are under extreme academic pressure, internships, financial stress, time crunches, all while maintaining their social lives on campus. Grocery shopping can often feel like an additional burden on top of already demanding and full schedules. From my personal experience I have found myself choosing stores based on convenience, like the Champaign target, rather than affordability or skipping trips entirely due to lack of transportation or time. These constant experiences revealed how even small inefficiencies can build over time and negatively impact students’ quality of life.

## Project Objective

This paper proposes a hypothetical open-source project called the Illini Grocery App, designed to specifically address grocery-related challenges that UIUC students and faculty may face. The goal of this paper is to describe the app itself and to demonstrate how I would manage its development using open-source principles and formal project management strategies to successfully launch the app. Some concepts I will discuss that I would potentially apply are Agile methodology, project scoping, community-driven development, feedback collection, and risk mitigation. I hope to explain this project to be a realistic, student-centered application that could be planned, built, and sustained. Creating this project based on my own experiences while applying structured project management techniques, I hope to show the thoughtful planning I have brainstormed to transform a personal idea into a viable and helpful initiative for my fellow students.

The need for a campus-specific grocery tool became apparent to me through both personal observation and conversations with my friends. Many university students rely on buses or walking to access grocery stores, which makes route planning and store selection very important. Prices for basic necessities can vary across nearby stores, like Target, Walmart, Meijers, however students often lack the time or tools to compare options efficiently. Yes, these stores have their inventory and prices online, but all on different sites with its own unique layout and some neglect important details that college students would need to decide which one to go to. Faculty members also face time constraints, with balancing teaching, research, and other personal responsibilities. These challenges show that grocery shopping is not just an inconvenience, but a structural issue affecting time management, accessibility, and financial ability across campus.

## User Research

To further validate this problem to ensure it’s a common need. I would start off this project with some preliminary user research. I plan to distribute short online surveys to UIUC students asking questions like how often they grocery shop, which stores they visit most frequently, if they would utilize an app to assist them, and what aspects of grocery shopping they find most frustrating or time consuming. I would also create other surveys to ask respondents to rank potential features such as price comparison, bus-route integration, store hours, and coupon tracking. To maximize participation, I would advertise the survey through social media platforms that are popular amongst UIUC students, including Instagram, Snapchat class stories, TikTok, GroupMe, Reddit, and campus Facebook groups. Posting in class-specific GroupMe chats, student organization pages, and UIUC-focused subreddits would help reach a diverse range of students across majors, class years, and living situations. I also think that partnering with research organizations on campus would be a good idea to get ensured responses and offer some sort of compensation to participants, funded by the school. All these approached will help ensure that the feedback for my project is not limited to my immediate social circle and helps confirm that the problem is widespread, and not just a personal issue.

## Project Scope

Based on initial research findings, I would define the Illini Grocery App as a lightweight, mobile app centered on efficiency, accessibility, and transparency. My goal is not to replicate a large commercial grocery platform (we already have enough of those), the app would focus specifically on UIUC and helping students and faculty make informed grocery decisions quickly and with minimal effort. Clearly defining the project’s scope at the beginning I believe is very critical to preventing feature creep, managing limited resources, and avoiding burnout among contributors, especially in a student-led open-source environment where time and availability are limited.

To make this plan more realistic, I think the concept of a minimum viable product (MVP) is vital to this project. The MVP is a foundation that gives immediate value to users while also giving room for future iteration. For the Illini Grocery App, I would limit the first release or prototype to three core features: item price comparison, store hours and locations, and route mapping. I selected these features because they directly address the most common pain points that people and I have experiences and brought up, most frequently affordability, time constraints, and transportation access. For example, a user searching for “eggs” would be able to view prices across multiple nearby grocery stores, along with distance, estimated travel time using public transportation, and whether the store is currently open. Each store’s page would show the hours of operation, address, bus routes, and walking distance from popular campus locations.

From a technical view, these features are also strategically chosen because they can be implemented incrementally without introducing too much complexity or confusion. Price comparison can initially rely on publicly available pricing data or manual updates, route mapping can use already existing APIs, and store information can be projected through a simple database structure. By prioritizing features in a beginning stage of this project that are both highly impactful and technically manageable, the MVP will stay realistic and within a student-managed timeline and will help new contributors adjust quickly to understand and participate in the codebase.

What is just as important is discussing what the MVP intentionally excludes. Advanced features such as personalized user accounts, price history tracking, or predictive coupon algorithms, or would be better for later phases of development. While these features might increase the long-term value, implementing them too early would potentially increase development time, introduce privacy concerns, and create unnecessary technical debt that could hurt our future scalability. For instance, user accounts would require authentication systems and data protection policies, while price history graphs would need much data collection and storage infrastructure. Putting these features in our back pocket to refer to later is a necessary management decision to prioritize stability, clarity, and sustainability during the early stages of creating a new platform.

## Iterative Development

I believe this approach will also help and propel iterative development and community contribution. Once the MVP is released and validated through user feedback, additional features can be proposed and evaluated through open discussion forums and issue tracking systems. For example, if users consistently request a shopping list feature or historical price comparisons, these ideas can be added to the project roadmap and implemented in future sprints. By clearly defining the MVP and its boundaries, the project maintains focus while still being adaptable.

## Feedback Integration

Once a beginning prototype of the Illini Grocery App is designed, I would like to hold usability testing sessions with a small, but diverse group of students, potentially including dorm residents, apartment renters, and graduate students. Recruitment for these sessions would be advertised on social media platforms, such as Instagram, GroupMe, and campus Facebook groups, inviting volunteers to try the prototype for small incentives like gift cards or campus dining credits. During testing, participants would be asked to perform realistic tasks, such as searching for an item, comparing prices across stores, and planning a route to multiple locations. I would observe their interactions, collect qualitative feedback on usability, and write down areas of confusion or pain points. I would then analyze and incorporate this feedback into iterative updates of the prototype, ensuring that design and functionality decisions are all backed up and grounded in real user behavior and opinions. This approach aligns with Agile principles by creating short, iterative cycles of development, testing, and refinement, to avoid the risk of building features that do not meet user needs and keeping the project focused on delivering high-value functionality and benefit.

## Feature Roadmap

Once the MVP is stable and has been validated through user feedback and prototype testing, future phases of development would be planned to introduce additional features. Phase two would focus on features that would enhance usability and personalization but not introduce too much complexity. For example, price history tracking would allow users to see trends for frequently purchased items over the past weeks or months, helping them make more informed decisions on what they might want to buy. To implement this, the functionality team would need to design a backend database capable of storing historical price data efficiently, while the usability team could create visualizations for the front end. An optional shopping list feature would let users compile items for a single trip, with automatic price comparisons across stores. This feature would require defining clear workflows for adding, editing, and deleting items, as well as testing for data consistency across devices. Each of these additions would be tracked in a detailed project roadmap with associated milestones, task assignments, and estimated timelines to ensure realistic deliverables.

Phase three would be concerned with more advanced features that increase community engagement and the app’s long-term sustainability. For example, crowd-sourced price updates would allow users to submit real-time information on item availability or store deals. To ensure data accuracy and prevent misinformation, a verification system would need to be implemented where submissions are reviewed by multiple contributors before being displayed in the app. Similarly, coupon aggregation would require integrating with public APIs or copying promotions from store websites, which would require testing pipelines to validate new coupon data and prevent errors. Both features would require and involve legal and privacy considerations, making it vital for there to be clear contributor guidelines and documentation and keeping in mind the principles of copyleft licensing and project transparency.

Each feature phase go along with Agile principles: work would be divided into 1–2 week sprints with clearly defined user stories, acceptance criteria, and success metrics. For instance, a user story for the shopping list feature might be: “As a student, I want to add items to a list and see total estimated costs across stores so I can plan my grocery trip efficiently.” Each sprint would end with usability testing and backlog refinement to change priorities based on feedback. Kanban boards would track progress visually, highlighting tasks in “to-do,” “in-progress,” “review,” and “done” columns to prevent bottlenecks and maintain transparency.

## Open-Source Model and Licensing

Choosing an open-source model will also be beneficial because of the community-focused nature of the app and my values as a student developer. Open-source development allows transparency in how data is collected, processed, and displayed which may be an important consideration when dealing with pricing information. It also encourages collaboration from students who want to contribute code, design, or research experience.

I would also choose a license such as the General Public License (GPL), which ensures that all future modifications remain open-source. This prevents the project from being commercialized or closed off by external parties. From a management perspective, this protects contributors’ work and builds trust within the project community.

Working open also means being diligent about maintaining public documentation, decision logs, and discussion threads. Feature proposals would be discussed openly through GitHub issues or discussion boards, allowing contributors to provide feedback before implementation. This transparency reduces miscommunication and ensures that decisions are made collaboratively, rather than by just one person.

## Team Structure

To manage contributions effectively, I would divide contributors into three vital teams: usability, design, and functionality. Each team would have clearly defined responsibilities, deliverables, and checkpoints. For example, the usability team would not only analyze survey results and conduct interviews but also define measurable success metrics, such as average task completion time during prototype testing or error rates in price comparisons. The design team would implement accessibility audits, ensuring features comply with ADA guidelines, and create reusable component libraries to streamline front-end development. The functionality team would create coding standards, implement automated tests for critical functions like route calculation, and maintain a version-controlled database schema.

Coordination across teams would be practiced through structured project management tools. Kanban boards would visualize each teams work, identify bottlenecks, and track dependencies between teams. Decision logs would document why and how certain design or technical choices were made, helping new contributors onboard and adjust quickly and maintaining consistency if team members graduate or leave. I would like to schedule weekly check-ins to focus on resolving blockers rather than reiterating completed tasks, and also producing asynchronous updates through shared platforms and chats like GitHub Discussions or Slack.

I would also focus on aligning deliverables with the project roadmap, mitigating risks, and ensuring iterative progress. For instance, if the functionality team is having delays due to API limitations, I could temporarily reassign usability team members to mock data testing to keep development moving. This approach would help us manage our resources, handle risks, and ensure everyone is accountable.

Agile methodology also supports flexibility and responsiveness. Development would happen in short sprints, with clearly defined goals. For instance, one sprint might focus only on implementing item search functionality, while another addresses route mapping.

Sprint retrospectives would encourage reflection on what worked well, what doesn’t need to be touched, and what needs improvement. If a feature proves to more complicated than expected, it can be rescheduled rather than forcing it to be done poorly or rushed in an unrealistic timeline. This approach would hopefully help manage risk and technical debt while maintaining steady progress.

## Version Control, Automation, and Documentation

GitHub would be the central platform for version control, collaboration, and project management. Every change to the Illini Grocery App would be submitted through pull requests, which would need to be reviewed before being put into the main codebase. For example, if a contributor adds a new feature for displaying store bus routes, another contributor or team would review the code to verify to avoid potential conflicts with functionality. This will help ensure high-quality code, prevent errors, and encourage learning among contributors by providing constructive feedback. Clear guidelines that include step-by-step instructions for utilizing the repository, running the app locally, and submitting pull requests, would be provided to help new developers onboard smoothly as teams and contributors may be shifting long term.

Automation tools would also play a critical role in maintaining code quality and avoiding repetitive work. Continuous integration pipelines could automatically run tests every time a pull request is submitted. For instance, if a contributor updates the price comparison feature, the CI workflow would automatically check that the new code correctly retrieves data from the store database, does not break route mapping functionality, and meets formatting standards. Additional automated checks could be linting pipelines to ensure consistent code style, tests to validate functionality, and accessibility checks to ensure that UI/UX elements are successful. By catching issues early in the development cycle, these automation tools prevent dangerous technical debt and allow contributors to focus on building new features rather than fixing avoidable errors.

Comprehensive documentation is also a vital process to ensure long-term maintainability. This could be a setup guide for installing dependencies, coding standards for both front-end and back-end development, API documentation for integrations such as transit maps or store data and troubleshooting guides for common errors users may face. For example, documentation might provide a template for adding a new store, explaining which information to include (address, hours, bus routes) and how to test that the information displays correctly in the app. Well-organized documentation allows contributors to work independently and reducing the need for constant supervision.

## Risk Management

Low participation and contributor drop-off is a common challenge in open-source and student-driven projects. Students and faculty may at first show interest but may not be able to maintain consistent engagement due to coursework, internships, or personal commitments. To help solve this issue, I would implement a clear onboarding process that includes contribution guides, coding standards, and tutorials for new contributors. For example, beginner-friendly tasks could be labeled in GitHub Issues, such as updating store hours, verifying price entries, or designing simple UI elements. Hosting regular virtual or in-person hackathons or coding sprints would also encourage collaboration and provide a sense of community and help contributors stay motivated. Recognizing contributions through shout-outs, announcements, or social media posts can also help incentivize participation.

Inaccurate or outdated data are also a significant risk, particularly for price comparison and store hours. If users find the information on the app is incorrect, they may no longer trust the app. To prevent this, I would implement automation techniques and community verification. For instance, scheduled scripts could scrape publicly available store websites or APIs to update store hours automatically. Additionally, user reporting mechanisms would allow app users to flag discrepancies or inconsistencies, creating a feedback loop that helps maintain data accuracy over time.

Time constraints and project delays are also a realistic risk because the project is being managed by students with different and busy schedules. I believe Kanban boards would help this by providing a visual tracking of tasks, making it easy to reassign or reprioritize work if someone is unavailable.

Lastly, maintaining transparency and documentation is critical to addressing these risks as best we can. By recording decisions, roadmaps, feature priorities, and technical guidelines in public repositories, reducing miscommunication. Open communication channels, such as GitHub Discussions, Slack, or Discord, would allow the team to share updates, ask questions, and collaboratively solve problems in real time.

## Conclusion

I believe that the Illini Grocery App will be a powerful a tool for simplifying grocery shopping and could be a successful student-centered initiative that is grounded in both user needs and project management concepts. Through surveys, interviews, and prototype testing, the project is designed to address real challenges faced by UIUC students and faculty, including affordability, accessibility, and time management. By defining a good MVP and implementing defining phases, the project balances immediate impact with long-term growth, while addressing and reducing risks such as technical debt, inaccurate data, and inconsistent contributor participation.

Applying structured project management practices, like Agile methodology, Kanban boards, sprints, retrospectives, and clear team structures, helps ensure that development is iterative, transparent, and collaborative. The open-source framework will strengthen sustainability by enabling community contributions, shared decision-making, and public documentation. Automation, version control, and comprehensive documentation enhance code quality and maintainability, supporting a project that can evolve even as team members may change over time.

Overall, the Illini Grocery App shows how thoughtful management, can transform a personal observation into a real, scalable solution for the campus community. It is an example of how student initiatives, when utilizing structured methodology and open collaboration, can create meaningful impact, improve daily life, and manifest a culture of participation, transparency, and innovation.
